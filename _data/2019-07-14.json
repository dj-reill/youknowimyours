I just wanted to give you a little (yikes) note to have with you to tell you that I'm thinking about you. I was remembering what you said about us having just enough time apart to do our own things and have those moments for ourselves, and I think its very good & grown-up & healthy & mature of us to ensure that we still can have our privacy & our solo time as well as our times together. I love that abour our relationship - that even if we spend lots of time together, we still value & prioritize our own personal individualities & needs. I am so grateful to be in a relationship where my needs (& wants!) are not only met, they are welcomed & anticipated with love & understanding. I love you so so endlessly for who you are, Mmy David! Never stop being you - and I will never stop loving you!/rYou Know I'm Yours,/rCarrie", "from": "Carrie", "location": "tbd"}
