I love the fact that every single day, every single letter I write you, there is something else new that makes me fall in love with you all over again. Each morning I wake up next to you, I thank God that I get to kiss your sweet face and hold your strong, beautiful hands in mine at least one more time before I have to face the big, exhausting world. You give me strength to take on anything life throws at me, simply by loving me and giving me such a reliable home to return to no matter how I feel./rYou are remarkable to me in so many ways, and I only wish there were more people in the world I could tell about how incredible you are. I am so proud of you, so immensely proud, for always going after your dreams & goals and of never seeming afraid of anything. You are an inspiration to me, and my favorite teacher. You've taught me more than I could ever tell, and I admire you for the grace and ease with which you do so. I love you for your authenticity, your ineffable friendliness, your cozy sngus, and dat cute ass ;). We may grow and change and get older but I enver want to stop being us. We are my favorite team. /rYou Know I'm Yours - always/r- Carrie",
