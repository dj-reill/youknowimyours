I am infinitely blessed that I get to live with someone who has only continued to lvoe me and support everything I do from day one. I truly would not be even half as successful without you by my side cheering me on. Somethings may start to change about our routines now that we see each other every day, but I will never get sick of the fact that I get to kiss you good morning and good night, and tell you how much I love you face to face, whenever I want. I know that my affection can sometimes be rather intense, and I apologize in advance and in retrospect if I have ever been too much. I rarely, rarely feel that way, because we have extremely strong communication, but now that we share a space I wanted to let you know that I am still working on tempering my actions so that everyone involved feels loved & respected at all times. I really, really, really love the way we grow individually and as a couple, and over the past two years your patience and kindness and emotional maturity have made it possible for me to mature as well. Because you have been willing to meet me where I am and accept me for myself, I have finally felt safe enough to truly dig deeper into my own past and begin to heal woudns I had forced myself to forget. You've given me a sanctuary in your heart, and I can not possibly express to you how deeply you've made me fall in love with you, and your sweet, kind, handsome self, and with your beautiful, compassionate soul. There is no one like you anywhere else, and that only helps me see the beauty of us finding each other in an even more remarkable way. /rI am forever grateful to you -/rand You Know I'm Yours-/rCarrie",
