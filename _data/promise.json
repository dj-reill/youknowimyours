  "content": "Carrie,\r\r\n\nNearly four years ago, we both agreed to six promises. These promises were wide ranging, but were completely encapsulating our relationship. \r\n\n* We would not laugh at each other. \r\n* We never tell anyone our secrets. \r\n* We never tickle each other. \r\n* We never hit below the belt. \r\n* We will never try to change one another.\r\n\r\n And finally,\r\n* We never stop loving each other.\r\r\n\nI think we should add another to this list of promises.\r\r\n\n Caroline Nicole Kirby, will you promise to share our love with the rest of the world? \n\nYou Know I'm Yours.\r\n\r\n-- David",
