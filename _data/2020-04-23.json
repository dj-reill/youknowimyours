I can't take away the expectations that others place on you, but I can assure you that I will do the best I can to support you however you need me to, for as long as you need me to. Being at home so much can really start to get to you, and with everything going on around us it can be hard to remember what it's all for. I want you to know that it is always okay to feel overwhelmed and to need space, and I will try always to understand and honor your needs as if they were my own, because you matter to me so, so deeply. I know that I am infinitely blessed to be able to have you by my side for whatever craziness life throws our way, as well as for all the wonderful & beautiful things we create & experience together. I have enjoyed every moment with you the past few weeks and am so proud of the way we have adapted & still managed to thrive! I love you so, so, so incredibly much and could not ask for a sweeter, kinder, or more patient and goofy beanienug to live with! I like you and I love you so much that I may even let you get my eucalyptus, who knows? ;)/r/nAs always, and even more every day,/rYou Know I'm Yours -/rCarrie xoxoxo", "from": "Carrie", "location": "tbd"}
