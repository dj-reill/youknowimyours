I had to make my first note on it be for you ;) The cover of this card really says it all. I love you more than all the stars! You are my favorite person in the galaxy, so I can say that and be just fine! ;)/rI love you so much. I support you and your dreams & aspirations and all your projects to the ends of the universe, and I think that you know by now that I am your biggest fan and your loudest cheerleader. You never cease to amaze me with your dreams! I treasure every moment we spend together, and there's nothing in the world more comforting than snuggling up ", "from": "Carrie", "location": "tbd"}
