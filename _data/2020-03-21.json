You light up my life in thousands of ways, every single day, and my life is far better for it! Never could I have dreamed up such a beautiful life for us, and I know without a doubt that I am the luckiest woman alive! I lvoe your kisses, the way you pull me close to you by putting your arms around me with your hands in the small of my back, and the way you tear up when we talk seriously about our love for each other. Your hugs make everything better, and you take my breath away with your never-ending kindness, generosity, and passion for helping others, no matter if they can return the favor or not. I count myself among those who are forever idnebted to you, as you know you have saved me a million times over. You are the greatest person I've ever known, and I am forever blessed to be able to experience the beauty of life by your side. You are the greatest gift I've ever received, and I hope I can treasure you the way you truly deserve to be loved! I adore you completely, totally, madly, and forever. I love living with you, living with my best friend!/r/nHere is to a thousand more years, loving, laughing, & learning on each other when we need to./r/nI'll be yours till the end of time - but you knew that - and You Know I'm Yours - always,/rCarrie xoxoxoxoxoxo*10^69.
