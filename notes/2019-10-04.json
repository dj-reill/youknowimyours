We have been together for so long now that I hardly expected to still get butterflies every time I see you, but here we are! You are just so incredibly breathtaking to me, for so many reasons. You are kind, you are humble, you are honest and fearless and brave, and you are everything I want in a person. Every time I get to wake up wit hyou, every afternoon I come home to your loving embrace, I thank my lucky starts that I have gotten to love you and be loved by you for the past few years./rWhile I know this letter will get to you later than the date on the paper, every word is only more & more true every day! Being at your sisters' wedding this weeking showed me even more clearly how much love and joy there is to be shared, in your whole family and in even just our relationship. You never fail to make me absolutely burst with joy, and the way you looked at me while we danced will never fade from my memory. It is truly enough for me that I get to be your girl - everything else is just the icing on the cake! /rI know I say thank you quite a lot, but I really am just so terribly grateful to be a part of so many beautiful moments, with your family and just between the two of us, that I feel just have to tell you how excited I am to be there! Every smile, every kiss, every party and dance & laugh we share brightens my life immeasurably. You are one in a billion, my angel - I love you 3000./rYou Know I'm Yours/r- Carrie",
