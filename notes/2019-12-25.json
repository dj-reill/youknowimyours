  "content": "My Sweetest David,/rI am beyond blessed to have you in my life. As we said the other night at dinner, I can't (and don't want to) imagine my life without you in it. You are the single greatest gift I have ever received, and you continue to give to me daily with your big, beautiful, loving, tender heart and incredibly generous soul. I learn from you each and every moment we are together, and I am in awe of how much love one person can feel for another, from me to you and vice-versa. The reason I tear up when we talk about our love for one another is because never in a million years could I have ever dreamed of being this happy, with the most icnredible and handsome and wonderful person I've ever had the privilege of knowing. I am blessed by your existence, my david-bean, and I never ever want to take one single second for granted. I only wish I could give you more of myself to show you just how grateful and happy and full of joy I am, always, as long as I have you in my life. If I could give you the stars, I would do it, if only to watch your perfect eyes light up with joy. You are my gift today & always!/rYou Know I'm Yours, Yours, Yours!/rAll my love, Carrie",
