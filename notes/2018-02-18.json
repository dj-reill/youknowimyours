I have loved getting to spend so much time with you this weekend, and it has made me more relaxed and prepared for my coming week than I was even hoping for. I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help with my website and all that. I never would have thoughtI could learn even this much about code and creating my own content from scratch. The fact that you took the time out of your Saturday to try to teach me not only a new concept I have never before breached, but to teach me an entirely new skill set, was just incredible to me. You made me feel smart, mature, and empowered in my own new knowledge, which not only struck me but made me grateful as well. How lucky am I to have a partner who not only lvoes and cares for me, but who continually pushes me to grow and learn and better myself at every opportunity! You inspire me, empower me, and encourage me to become the person I am meant to be every single day. You are truly the living breathing example of 1 Corinthians 13:4, and I could not be more blessed to have you in my life. My only regret is that I am now out of room to gush about how much I ador you. You Know I'm Yours/r-Carrie",
