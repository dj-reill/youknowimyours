I haven't written you a letter in a while and today seemed like a good day to remind you how important you are to me. /r/nI am so excited to finally be seriously house hunting with you!!! This is like my wildest(most basic white girl) dreams come true - I am so excited for so many reasons, but the main thing I'm excited about is the fact that we will get to have our very own place to design, setup, redo, re-redo, worry about, take care of, and make beautiful new memories in together. The very idea that we will have somewhere happy & quiet & full of joy and music and laughter and all the snugs in the world makes we want to put an offer in on any house (literally anywhere, I don't even care if it's not renovated or full of bugs) Right NOW!! /r/nThe most amazing part of it though, even despite all of my excitement in the previous paragraph, is the incredible amount of hope & optimism I am feeling about us & our life together, even despite all the craziness this year has brought. I've never felt so <u>right</u> about something as I feel about you - you complete me & compliment me in ways I didn't know I needed, and you teach me patience and love and perserverence every day in ways you don't even realize. You can't begin to imagine how blessed I feel to be loved by someone so utterly breathtaking as you, so completely kind & smart and hilarious as my David bean. /r/n It's like I won the lottery every single day with you - never stop being your wonderful self - I love you 3,000! /r/n You know I'm Yours, /r Carrie xoxoxoxâˆž",
