At least one vacation, a new job, a new roommate, countless happy hours and dinners together, and so, so, so many kisses! I love living together. I love it so much because not onnly am I so incredibly happy, to get to spend as much time with you as I want is basically the greatest gift you could ever give me. I get to kiss you goodnight and good morning, I get to sit on the porch with you and sip coffee on the weekend mornings, I get to be the one you make love with and fall asleep naked with. And do you know the actual best part of all this heaven? It's that you enjoy these moments as much as I do. You really *want* it to be me you do these things with. That is seriously the most incredible feeling ever./rYou bring so much joy into so many people's lives, and to witness that joy and humor and vitality on a daily basis has made me a better person as well. I am so infinitely blessed to have you, and I strive everyday to keep on bettering myself and to learn & grow while watching you do the same. I can neither give nor take all the credit for my own successes in the past few years, but I would be lying if I said you were not part of the best reasons. You have changed my lfie for the better, and you keep making me see even the most tiny ways you save me very day. You are a calm for my soul, the steadiest hand to hold when I'm in need, and the most comfortable and safe place to rest my weary head at the end of a long day. /rLove me forever, will ya? ;)/rYou know I will - You know I'm yours /r-Carrie",
